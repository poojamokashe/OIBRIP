            Vikram Ambalal Sarabhai (12 August 1919 – 30 December 1971) 
            was an Indian physicist and astronomer who initiated space research
            and helped develop nuclear power in India. He was honoured with 
            Padma Bhushan in 1966 and the Padma Vibhushan (posthumously) in 
            1972. He is internationally regarded as the Father of the Indian 
            Space Program.</p>

            <h3>Personal life</h3>

            Vikram and Mrinalini Sarabhai (1948)
            Son of Ambalal Sarabhai, he came from the famous Sarabhai 
            family from India who were major industrialists committed to 
            the Indian independence movement. Vikram Sarabhai married the
            classical dancer Mrinalini in 1942. The couple had two children. 
            His daughter Mallika gained prominence as an actress and activist, 
            and his son Kartikeya too became an active person in science. 
            During his lifetime, he practiced Jainism. He attended Gujarat
            College, Ahmedabad, but later moved to the University of Cambridge,
            England, where he took his tripos in natural sciences in 1940.
            In 1945 he returned to Cambridge to pursue PhD and wrote a thesis,
             “Cosmic Ray Investigations in Tropical Latitudes,” in 1947
            </p>

            <h3>Proffessional life</h3>

            Known as the cradle of space sciences in India, the Physical 
            Research Laboratory (PRL) was founded in 1947 by Vikram 
            Sarabhai.[8] PRL had a modest beginning at his residence, the 
            "RETREAT", with research on cosmic rays. The institute was
            formally established at the M.G. Science Institute, 
            Ahmedabad, on 11 November 1947[9] with support from the 
            Karmkshetra Educational Foundation and the Ahmedabad 
            Education Society. Prof. Kalpathi Ramakrishna Ramanathan 
            was the first Director of the institute. The initial focus
            was research on cosmic rays and the properties of the upper 
            atmosphere. Research areas were expanded to include 
            theoretical physics and radio physics later with grants 
            from the Atomic Energy Commission. He led the Sarabhai
            family-owned business conglomerate. His interests varied
            from science to sports to statistics. He set up the 
            Operations Research Group (ORG), the first market 
            research organization in the country.

            <h3>Death</h3>

        
            On 30 December 1971, Sarabhai was to review the SLV design 
            before his departure for Bombay the same night. He had spoken 
            to A. P .J. Abdul Kalam on the telephone. Within an hour of the 
            conversation, Sarabhai died at the age of 52 due to cardiac arrest
            in Trivandrum (now Thiruvananthapuram). His body was cremated in 
            Ahmedabad.
